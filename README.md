# Light Split
### Description
On a group trip, people usually cover different parts of the expenses. For example, friend A might be in charge of booking plane tickets for the group, and friend B 
booking hotels and renting a car. During the trip, more shared expenses will occur, and it'll be a hassle to pay each other back everytime it happens. **Light Split solves this
problem by minimizing such internal transactions at the end of the trip.** Just a few clicks to document who pays and who shares the expense and Light Split will keep track 
of transaction.
